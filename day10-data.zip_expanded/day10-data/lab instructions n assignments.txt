Day 1
1. Create a new workspace for core Java
2. import day1.1 in your new workspace
Refer to readmes n diagrams , from today's help
3. Revise
flow, keywords n custom exceptions

4. Complete your pending work


Day 2
In the individual labs :
import day2.1 n revise
1. date_handling (Date class , SimpleDateFormat , parse n format methods)
2. string_handling (String n StringBuilder classes)
3. Revise wrapper classes
Solve : "day2_data\day2_help\wrappers code\Test.java"

4. Revise  inheritance in i/fs 

5. Reading n solving H.W
Important methods of the String class
concat,charAt,indexOf,lastIndexOf,toUpperCase,toLowerCase,format,split,matches,substring,startsWith,endsWith,trim

6. 
Objective : Showroom Management system , which will keep track of vehicles added in the showroom.

Objective : Accept vehicle details : chasisNo(string) : Unique ID, color(enum) , basePrice(double) , manufactureDate(Date),company,isAvailable

Note : vehicle's base price will increase as per the chosen color

Add  validation rules

6.1 manufactureDate : must be in after 1st Jan 2021
6.2 Vehicle color must be valid

Create a Tester class
Accept vehicle details. 
Invoke validation rules.
If n only if all validations succeed , then create Vehicle object.
Use toString to display it's details.


Day 3
In the individual labs , revise completely'
1.import day3.1 , to revise overriding of equal , using simple PK
2.import day3.2 , to revise overriding of equal , using compound PK
3. import day3.3 , to revise
validation rules
LocalDate API
custom exception 


4. Hands on (Complete as much as possible!)

We are going to build Customer management system, over next few days.

Typical  Options
1. Sign up (customer registration)
2. Sign in (login)
i/p : email n password
3. Change password
i/p : email n old password n new password
4. Un subscribe customer
i/p : customer email
5. Display all customers.
and many more.....
0. Exit 

Design 
Identify the core classes/enums involved
1. Customer class (core class)
state  : customer id(int) ,first name, last name (string),email(string),password(string),registrationAmount(double),dob(LocalDate),plan(ServicePlan : enum)
Must generate customer ids automatically : auto increment)
PK(UID) : email

Add suitable constructors.

Will you need to override toString n equals ?


2. ServicePlan : enum
ServicePlan charges : 
SILVER : 1000 
GOLD : 2000
DIAMOND : 5000
PLATINUM : 10000


3. custom exception class

4. validation rules
4.1 no dup customers 
(i.e if the customer tries to register using existing email , throw exception)

4.2 Validate plan
plan must be of supported types

4.3 reg amount must match with the plan


5. Tester, with UI , use scanner
Accept customer details
Validate i/ps (single method)
In case of successful validations , display customer details via toString or displat error mesg via custom exception.



Day 4
In the combined lab , revise : 
1. import day4.2 in your workspace
(File --import --General --Existing projects in workspace --Browse n choose project folder 
check copy check box , to copy it in your workspace.)
1.1 Refer to sample data , from today's sequence.
1.2 Add a method in ShowroomUtils to return populated showroom.
1.3. Revise all options

2. Hands on (complete as much as possible)
Continue with day3 customer assignment
If you have completed it , continue with your project or import "day3_lab_practice" in your workspace.
Solve these options

1. Sign up (customer registration)

2. Sign in (login)
i/p : email n password

3. Change password
i/p : email n old password n new password

4. Un subscribe customer
i/p : customer email

5. Display all customers.

0. Exit 



Day 5
1. import day5.1 , to revise
1.1 Custom ordering (based upon Comparator)
1.2 Iterators n ListIterator n exceptions involved
1.3 ArrayList vs LinkedList
(solve : day5.1\src\linked_lists\TestLinkedList.java)

2. import day5.2 , to revise Set functionality n it's implementation classes.


2. Complete pending work (customer management system)
Continue 
2.1 Solve : 
Sort customer details as per email , using Natural Ordering
2.2 Sort customer details as per date of birth , using custom ordering
2.3 Sort customer details as per date of birth n last name , using custom ordering n anonymous inner class

2.4 
1. As an admin , how will you find out the complete names of the customers , who have not paid the subscription (reg amount) , for last 3 months ?
Hint : 
Add instance field in Customer : lastSubscriptionPaidDate : LocalDate
initialize in the ctor  : to reg date (LocalDate.now())
Add option in tester(under customer role) : to pay reg / subscription amount
(Currently there are no roles , will be added later !)
eg : for (Customer c: customerList)
       {
          long months=Period.between(c.getLastSubscriptionPaidDate(), LocalDate.now()).toTotalMonths();
          if(months > 3)
           sop(c.getFirstName()+" "+c.getLastName());
       }

2. Add another option (admin) : display complete names of the customers , who have not paid the subscription (reg amount) , for last 3 months ?
Hint : 
for-each : 
API hint : java.time.Period , between(...) , toTotalMonths()


3. How will you remove all those customer details whose subscription is pending for last 6 months?
Iterator : remove 
API hint : java.time.Period , between(...) , toTotalMonths()
(as discussed earlier)
eg : Iterator<Customer> itr=custList.iterator();
while(itr.hasNext())
{
   Customer c=itr.next();
   long months=Period.between(c.getLastSubscriptionPaidDate(),        	LocalDate.now()).toTotalMonths();
 if(months > 6)
  itr.remove();
}

Add a new option , for the customer to pay the subscription
i/p : email,password ,plan, subscription
simply set getLastSubscriptionPaidDate to LocalDate.now();



1. Mandatory reading exercise
1.1 Open ArrayList from java docs.
Refer to "fail-fast" behavior of the iterators
1.2 ArrayList vs LinkedList
(from readme)
1.3 LinkedList additional API (from summary table of  javadocs of : Dequeue i/f)
eg : addFirst, addLast,removeFirst,removeLast ....


Day 6

In the combined lab
We will try to complete customer assignment as much as possible ,  using List.


In the individual labs , 
1. import day6.1 , to revise hashing algorithm n hashtable data structure in java
refer :readmes n diagrams

2. import day6.2 , to revise Map API 
refer : readme


Day 7
1. import day7.1 , to revise Map API
2. import day7.2 , to revise generic syntax n example of higher order function : forEach

3. Solve pending objectives from CMS
sorting n removal

4. Extra practice of generics
0. solve : "day7-data\generic-questions.txt"



Day 8

1. import day8.1 to revise
1.1 Lambda expressions
1.2 Functional streams

Solve for more practice : 

1.  Display all product names of a particular category , exceeding specific price. (from product list)
I/P category name & price.
Hint : stream , filters , map , forEach

2  Prompt user for category n discount. (from product map)
Apply that discount on all products of specified category n print those product details after applying the discount
i/p : category n discount

2.5 Print avg of squares of all nos > 50 from this data source
{10,20,23,56,1,456,70,78,90}
Hint : of , filter , map , reduce (average) , orElseThrow

3. Use  student based scenario.(use ready code)
 Display all student details from a student list

4. Display all student details(list) sorted as per GPA (from product map)
Use custom ordering
eg : Comparator<Student> comp=(s1,s2) -> ((Double)s1.getGPA()).compareTo(s2.getGPA());
map.values().stream().sorted(comp).forEach(s -> sop(s));//System.out::println

5. Write a tester to print average of  gpa of students for the specified course/subject
eg : i/p : course
o/p : average GPA
eg : double avgGPA=list.stream().filter(s -> s.getSubject()==subject).mapToDouble(s -> s.getGPA()).average().orElseThrow();

6 Print name of specified subject  topper
eg : String topperName=map.values().stream().filter(s -> s.getSubject()==subject).max(comp).orElseThrow().getName();

7. Print no of  failures for the specified subject from the specified city ,chosen  from user.
(gpa < 5 : failed case)
eg : map.values().stream().filter(s -> s.getSubject()==subject)
.filter(s -> s.getAddress().getCity().equals(chosenCity))
.filter(s -> s.getGPA()<5)
.count()


8. Given a List of strings, write a program to count the number of strings that start with a specific character using streams.
eg : list.stream().filter(s -> s.startsWith("a")).count();


Day 9

1. import day9.1 to revise Java 8 Functional streams

2. import day9.2 to revise text file handling

3. Complete Day 8 pending work

4. Solve 
(Integration of Collections n I/O)
Refer to student scenario (accept student details from a Map)
Start the app with populated Map of students
(Can you modify populateMap further , for better FP style ?)
Hint :collect(Collectors.toMap(keyMapper,valueMapper));

Options
1. Display all student details
2. Cancel Admission
i/p : rollNo
2.5 Cancel Course/Subject
i/p : subject name
o/p : remove details of all students , enrolled in that course

3. Store student details
i/p : subject n city
Store passed student details(GPA > 6)  as per the specified subject n city , sorted as per DoB , in a text file using buffer.
0. Exit



5. Optional work (Interesting !)
Suppose you have this text file : emps.data
Emp ID Name DeptName Salary Dob Permanent
10,Rama,RnD,10000,1990-01-01,true
1,Shekhar,Finance,12000,1990-01-01,false
20,Mihir,RnD,11000,1989-05-01,false
15,Madhavi,HR,15000,1992-02-11,true
..........
Print the name of the emp from specified department , earning least salary
Print average salary for the emps from specifid dept
Sort the emps as per Dob n display the same
Collect all of the permanent emps in a list n display the same



Day 10

1. import day10.1 n day10.2 , in your workspace , to revise 
serialization n de-serialization
(You will see errs in day10.2 , since you won't have product_dep.jar)
So create it n then add it in build path(i.e run time classpath)


2. Mandatory assignment (try to at least start with it today!)
(Integration of Collections n I/O)
Refer to student scenario (copy core classes , custom exc . No need of ShopUtils)
Add IOUtils  i/f : with 2 methods
for storing n re storing student details
(ser n de ser)

In the Tester Application
1.  Restore the Map from bin file (in case of no file or any errs , you should start with the EMPTY Map)

Options
1. Student Admission
2. Display all student details
3. Cancel Admission
i/p : rollNo
4. Find out specific student's details
i/p : rollNo
0. Exit

Before terminating from the app, in Exit option, store student details using ser.
